I shall begin to update the various files' Release Status as soon as I have finished uploading them all.
Currently:
  * pretty much every ```.zs``` file can be considered (Beta) as they work, but are all [WIP], and most are just a Template.
  * if it is in ZenScript Format, but is a .txt, then:
    * it is either a Template for any new .zs files
    * or, it is in (Alpha)
  * Nothing in this folder is technically considered (Release) yet.
