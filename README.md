# MT-ZenScript
My collection of MineTweaker 3 / ModTweaker 2 ZenScript Files, along with a few I've found that I'll likely integrate later.

These are available for sharing and sugestions (you can use the issue Tracker for Sugestions).

Release Catigories:
* (Alpha) there's a good chance that I have absolutely zero clue if it actually will work, or I was trying to get it to work and was unable [Future WIP].
* (Beta) It works, but there may possibly be Errors, and it may be a Work In Progress. [WIP]
* (Release) I finished Indexing and writing the Script for this Mod. [Completed]

All of these Catigories are open to sugestions.

Mostly I'm building these for use in my own personal Mod Pack, attempting to get everything in order for a smooth seamless Adventure Mode Playthrough.

General Terms of Use: If you desire to utilize these for yourself, it's nothing that can't be typed up, so feel free to download them here, edit your copy, learn what you can, etc.

I utilize the Creative Commons Licence because:
* These Scripts are provided Free of Charge ($0.00).
* These Scripts promote and encourage the use of MineTweaker 3 and ModTweaker 2 Mods both.
  * without any prearranged form of payment from them to me for this Advertising I might add.
* Lastly, because I typed my entire Scripts folder myself!
  * at least I did when I started this GitHub Repository.
  * any future Forks obviously might not be me.
    * those persons will recieve Credit where Credit is due.
